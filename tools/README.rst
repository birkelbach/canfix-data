This directory contains various tools for automatically generating or managing the data files in this distribution.

Primarily the *index.py* file is used to generate the main data index file

The eds_gen directory contains scripts that can be used to generate various eds files.  Some eds files
are quite repetitive and/or complex so generating them with scripts makes sense.
